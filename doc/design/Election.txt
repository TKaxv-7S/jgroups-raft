Election based on JGroups views
===============================

Author: Bela Ban


Motivation
----------
The current impl of jgroups-raft ignores the functionality (failure detection, view changes) JGroups offers and
implements leader election more or less as described in [1].

By rewriting that part to reuse JGroups functionality, the following advantages can be had:
* Code reduction, reuse of proven code
* Many failure detection protocols are available
* Ability to customize failure detection
* No constant traffic by heartbeats; a leader establishes itself once and then remains leader until a new view starts a
  new leader election
* No elections unless triggered by view changes -> this reduces competing elections (but doesn't eliminate them)
* Simple implementation of dynamic membership changes (ch. 4 in [1]); no need to append special configuration entries
  to the log


In a nutshell
-------------
* Leader election is started only on view changes, depending on the view
* Once a leader is established, there won't be any elections or heartbeats until a new view is installed
* New members get the term and the leader's address via a message from the current leader (HeartbeatMessage)
* New members don't take part in voting until the leader has sent them the above message. This makes it easy to
  dynamically change the majority when adding members


Implementation
--------------

State
-----
- ELECTION.active: when false, drop vote requests
- ELECTION.majority: votes needed for majority (initially set via XML). Dynamically set thereafter


On reception of view change V
-----------------------------
- If v.size < majority:
    - Stop elections
    - If leader -> become candidate
    - Else -> leader=null
- Else // v.size >= majority
    - If leader == null or leader not in V -> start elections
    - If leader -> send heartbeat (leader / term) to new member(s)


On leader elected
-----------------
- Leader
    - Send heartbeat (leader / term) to all followers (regular message, *not* OOB)
    - Stop elections


On reception of heartbeat HB
----------------------------
- Set term to HB.term
- Set leader to HB.leader
- Stop elections
- If not active -> set active to true
